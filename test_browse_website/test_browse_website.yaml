      in Greek, without any intention of publication, by the only Roman emperor who
      was also a philosopher, the Meditations of Marcus Aurelius (AD 121-180) offer
      a remarkable series of challenging spiritual reflections and exercises developed
      as the emperor struggled to understand himself and make sense of the universe.
      Ranging from doubt and despair to conviction and exaltation, they cover such
      diverse topics as the nature of moral virtue, human rationality, divine providence,
      and Marcus'' own emotions. But while the Meditations were composed to provide
      personal consolation and encouragement, in developing his beliefs Marcus Aurelius
      also created one of the greatest of all works of philosophy: a timeless collection
      of extended meditations and short aphorisms that has been consulted and admired
      by statesmen, thinkers and readers through the centuries. ...more Product Information
